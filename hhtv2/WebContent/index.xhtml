		For several years the application of the Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) to image processing has been encumbered by numerical and mathematical difficulties. Only recently, scientists at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, in collaboration with other scientists at major research centers in the US and abroad, proved that was possible to develop a practically useful version of the HHT in two dimensions (HHT2).<br/>
		HHT2 promises superior advantages in remote sensing, and Syneren Technologies with its SIETech algorithm overtook the challenge of developing an operational-parallelized version of the NASA&acute;s HHT2 code supplemented by a novel method for Hilbert Spectral Analysis (HSA). During the development process, in-house tests performed on SIETech were presented and discussed at international conferences confirming the new opportunities for practical applications that it offers due to its superior ability to detecting image signatures and of filtering patterns.<br/>
		This new technology offers:
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>New opportunities for multi-image registration by providing new options for comparing and integrating the information contained in different images.</li>
		<li>Effective multi-dimensional data analysis suitable for improved instrument design, observational requirements optimization, and remote sensing enhancements.</li>
		</ul>
